            In today&apos;s AI-driven world, standing out is harder than ever.
            While anyone can build a product, a professional landing page makes
            the difference between success and failure.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 max-w-[600px]">
            No-code tools lock you into their ecosystem with recurring fees and
            limited control. They often come with performance issues and make it
            difficult to integrate with your product.

            You can&apos;t even change your hosting provider and basic things
            like web analytics come as extra costs and paid add-ons.

            What might seem like a convenient solution today could paint you

            professional quality.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 max-w-[580px]">
            Launch UI stands out with premium design quality and delightful
            touches of custom animations and illustrations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 max-w-[580px]">
            All components are carefully crafted to help position your product
            as a professional tool, avoiding the generic template look.

            Unlike many libraries that rely on outdated CSS practices and old
            dependencies, Launch UI is built with modern technologies and best
            practices in mind.

            The basic version of Launch UI is open-source and free forever,

            The pro version that contains more components and options is a
            one-time purchase that gives you lifetime access to all current and

            projects - no recurring fees or restrictions.
